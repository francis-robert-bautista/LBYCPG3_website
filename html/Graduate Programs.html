To further complicate the problem, images are often corrupted with varying levels of noise. The presence of noise reduces the compressibility of data while reducing the quality of images in general which makes the problem of image denoising important as well.

This course introduces the different properties and representations while going through common and state-of-the-art techniques associated with different image processing problems. Exercises using MATLAB will be provided throughout the entire course to supplement the different discussions.
